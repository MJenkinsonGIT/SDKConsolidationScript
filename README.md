# Garmin Connect IQ SDK — LLM Reference Builder

A Python script that converts the Garmin Connect IQ SDK HTML documentation into clean, LLM-friendly Markdown. Run it once against your local SDK install and get a structured reference you can feed selectively to a local language model without it drowning in boilerplate, navigation chrome, or device lists for 160 devices you're not targeting.

---

## Why This Exists

The Connect IQ SDK ships its API reference as hundreds of individual HTML files with navigation headers, footers, and "Supported Devices" lists that list every Garmin product ever made. When working with local LLMs (or with Claude via a context window), loading even a handful of these raw HTML files wastes a significant portion of the available context on irrelevant content.

This script strips all of that and produces clean Markdown files — one per class — plus consolidated indexes, sample projects, and templates, all ready to load into a model's context exactly when they're needed.

It also supports a **device-specific build mode**: when you're developing for a specific device, it can tailor the entire output to that device — silently removing supported-device lists where your device is covered, and injecting a visible warning (`⚠️ Not supported on venu3.`) wherever an API member or method is not available on your target device.

## About This Project

This script was built through **vibecoding** — a development approach where the human provides direction, intent, and testing, and an AI (Claude by Anthropic) writes the code. Every line of Python was written by Claude. My role was to describe what I wanted, test each iteration, report what worked and what didn't, and keep iterating.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or later
- The Garmin Connect IQ SDK installed locally (tested against **SDK 8.4.1**, released February 2026)
- Two third-party packages:

```
pip install beautifulsoup4 markdownify
```

- `tkinter` for the graphical SDK root and device picker dialogs (included with most Python installs; falls back to a text prompt if unavailable)

---

## Usage

```
python build_sdk_reference.py
```

On launch, two dialogs appear:

1. **SDK root picker** — browse to your Connect IQ SDK folder (the one containing `doc/`, `samples/`, etc.)
2. **Device picker** — choose a specific target device for a tailored build, or select "All devices — general build" at the top of the list for a full unfiltered output

The script runs in under 30 seconds and writes everything to a `Consolidated SDK/` folder directly inside your SDK root.

## General vs Device-Specific Builds

### General build

All "Supported Devices" sections are preserved exactly as they appear in the SDK. The Device Reference directory contains all ~160 device files. Use this if you're not targeting a specific device or want to understand cross-device compatibility.

### Device-specific build

When you select a target device, the output is tailored in four ways:

| Area | Behaviour |
|------|-----------|
| API member/method supported on your device | "Supported Devices" section stripped — support is implied, no need to list it |
| API member/method **not** supported on your device | Section replaced with **`⚠️ Not supported on [device].`** inline warning |
| Device Reference | Only `Overview.md` + your device's file included |
| Sample manifests | `<iq:products>` lists stripped to reduce noise |

The normalisation handles the full range of Garmin product naming: registered/trademark symbols (`®`, `™`), accented characters (fēnix → fenix), and combined entries like "Edge® 1040 / 1040 Solar" are all matched correctly.

### How useful is the device-specific build?

For a **Garmin Venu 3**, the numbers are:

- The Device Reference shrinks from **2.53 MB / 164 files → ~25 KB / 2 files**
- The Toybox API docs lose approximately **196 KB of "Supported Devices" list text (~50K tokens)**
- Total output reduction: roughly **2.7 MB / ~675K tokens**

The practical value of the token savings depends on how much of the reference you load at once — for task-focused development you'd typically only load a handful of files at a time, so the savings on those files are moderate rather than transformational.

The **warning injection** is where the device-specific build earns its keep. Across the full Venu 3 API surface, exactly **13 unsupported members and methods** were identified:

| Module | Unsupported item |
|--------|-----------------|
| `Attention` | `hasFlashlightColor()` |
| `BluetoothLowEnergy` | `getBondedDevices()` |
| `System.DeviceSettings` | `fontScale` |
| `System.DeviceSettings` | `isNightModeEnabled` |
| `PersistedContent` | `getAppCourses()`, `getAppRoutes()`, `getAppTracks()` |
| `PersistedContent` | `getCourses()`, `getRoutes()`, `getTracks()` |
| `PersistedLocations` | *(module-level)* |
| `WatchUi` | `getSubscreen()` |

The compatibility information for all of this is present in the general build too — it's the same "Supported Devices" lists that the script reads to generate these warnings. The difference is reliability of consumption. In the general build, an LLM has to actively read each device list, correctly identify whether the target device appears in it, and do that consistently across 101 separate occurrences. Device name matching is surprisingly error-prone: Garmin's naming includes symbols like `®` and `™`, accented characters (fēnix), combined entries like "Edge® 1040 / 1040 Solar", and names that share substrings (Venu® 3 vs Venu® 3S vs Venu® 4 45mm / D2™ Air X15). During development of this script, a purpose-built matching function initially produced a false positive on `fontScale` because an unrelated entry contained the character "3". A language model parsing the same lists ad hoc is exposed to the same class of error. The device-specific build eliminates that risk by doing the matching once, deterministically, and replacing each list with either silence (supported) or an unambiguous inline warning (not supported) that is hard to miss.

The Venu 3 is a relatively broad-compatibility device (88 of 101 "Supported Devices" sections confirm support). For a more constrained device — a cycling Edge computer or an older watch — the ratio would be less favourable and the filtering would matter proportionally more.

## What Gets Converted

| Source | Output |
|--------|--------|
| `doc/Toybox/*.html` + subdirs | One `.md` per class under `docs/Toybox/` |
| `doc/docs/**/*.html` | Programmer's guide under `docs/docs/` |
| `samples/*/` | One `.md` per sample project |
| `templates/*/` | One `.md` per template variant |
| `doc/resources/` images | Catalog entries in `SDK_IMAGE_CATALOG.md` |

### HTML processing pipeline

Each HTML file goes through the following steps before becoming Markdown:

1. `nav`, `header`, `footer` tags removed
2. "Supported Devices" sections handled (stripped or replaced with warning, depending on build mode)
3. Language hints transferred from `<pre class="java ...">` to inner `<code>` tag — Garmin uses `java` and `typescript` class names for Monkey C code; these are mapped to ` ```monkeyc `
4. `<img>` elements removed (catalogued separately)
5. `<dl>/<dt>/<dd>` definition lists flattened to bold/plain paragraph pairs
6. `<main>` extracted (falls back to `<body>`)
7. `markdownify` converts to Markdown
8. CRLF → LF normalisation
9. Dead `.html` links converted to backtick inline code
10. `[show all](#)` / `[collapse](#)` UI artefacts stripped
11. Excess blank lines collapsed

Sample and template projects are consolidated into single Markdown files with an ASCII project tree at the top, followed by all source files in order (manifest → jungle → resources → `.mc` source).
